1.0.5
Putting this here to prevent auto-update since 1.1 versions are not working correctly at all


1.1.1
Reduce installer size
* The installer is enormous for what a small program this is like wtf
---
1.1.0
Options menu
+ A window will open when the program is opened via a shortcut which is not the Start-Up shortcut
+ Can select which rockets will cause notifications
---
1.0.5
One instance at a time
* When an instance of the program is already running, the newly launched instance will terminate it first
* Hopefully auto-update will now actually work
---
1.0.4
Auto-updates
+ The program will now automatically check for updates on the remote server (GitHub)
---
1.0.3
Improved error handling
* Added option to error call whether or not to notify the user of the error
- Error due to lack of internet or nonresponding server will no longer appear
---
1.0.2
Start at startup
+ The installer will now configure the program to run at startup
---
1.0.1
Improved errors
+ Errors will now show in a separate screen
+ 'Dismiss'-button now works as intended
* Better, more complete, catching of errors
