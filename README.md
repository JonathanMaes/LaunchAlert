# Jonathan's Launch Alert
This is a launch notification program.
When the program is run, it will periodically check for imminent launches. You will receive a notification at several important times before the launch, like T-1 day, T-1 hour and T-1 minute. The name of the mission, as well as the rocket, provider, and location of the launch are shown in the notification. When a livestream is available, a button inside the notification will allow the user to automatically view the launch online.

For now, the program doesn't start itself when your PC boots itself, this is however a planned feature.
