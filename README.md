# Jonathan's Launch Alert
This is a launch notification program, which will notify the user of any imminent launches of orbital launch systems.
When the program is run, it will periodically check for imminent launches. You will receive a notification at several important times before the launch, like T-1 day, T-1 hour and T-1 minute. The name of the mission, as well as the rocket, provider, and location of the launch are shown in the notification. When a livestream is available, a button inside the notification will allow the user to automatically view the launch online.

The program will automatically start running in the background when your computer starts.

The source code used for the development can, unsurprisingly, be found in the source/ folder.
(Warning: extremely amateuristic source code ahead!)
